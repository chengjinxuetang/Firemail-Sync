# Contributing to Mailspring-Sync

We're always looking for help improving the stability, performance, and
functionality of Mailspring-Sync. There are a few ways to get involved:

## Contributing Code

One of the best ways is to grab a
[bug report](https://community.getmailspring.com/c/bugs/10),
[sync issue](https://community.getmailspring.com/c/sync/22),
or [feature suggestion](https://community.getmailspring.com/c/features/12)
that has been marked `accepted` and dig in. We mark anything specific to
Mailspring-Sync with `mailsync`. You can especially look for issues
marked as `help-wanted` or `low-hanging-fruit`.

Please be wary of working on issues *not* marked as `accepted`. Just because
someone has created an issue doesn't mean we'll accept a pull request for it.

### Pull requests

We welcome PRs that fix bugs, improve functionality, or clean up the code,
*but not all at once*. It's easier to merge PRs that focus on one thing.
It's a lot easier to feel safe merging a big PR that moves things around if
we know the author was ONLY moving things around, and not changing the
business logic at the same time.

The first time you submit a pull request, a bot will ask you to sign a
standard, bare-bones Contributor License Agreement. The CLA states that you
waive any patent or copyright claims you might have to the code you're
contributing. (For example, you can't submit a PR and then sue Mailspring
for using your code.)

## Triaging Issues

Another way to help is to [answer questions](https://community.getmailspring.com/c/help/7),
or to triage [bug reports](https://community.getmailspring.com/c/bugs/10) and
[sync issues](https://community.getmailspring.com/c/sync/22). If you're good at
testing and addressing issues, we'd love your help!

## Filing Issues

If you have a bug to report or a feature to suggest, you may do so on our
[Discourse](https://community.getmailspring.com/). Please carefully follow all
instructions in the template for the given type of issue you're reporting.

We also ask that you search for existing issues, *including closed ones!*
We're in the process of migrating. If someone has already reported a bug or
requested the feature you have in mind,  **vote for it** at the top.
Higher voted issues are more likely to be addressed.

For bugs, please verify that you're running the latest version of Mailspring
(and thus, Mailsync). If you file an issue without providing detail, we may
close it without comment.

**Under no circumstances should you report an issue via GitHub. The GitHub
Issues feature is exclusively for Mailspring contributors to track tasks
which have been diagnosed, accepted, and scheduled on the roadmap.**

# Build and Run From Source

(We'll be adding this section soon! Please stay tuned.)

discussion to English and keep things on topic with the issue. Be considerate
to others and try to be courteous and professional at all times.
